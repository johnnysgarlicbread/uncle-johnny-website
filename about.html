      <img src="arlotta_oil.jpeg" alt="Arlotta Garlic Infused Olive Oil" style="width:80%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:8px;" />
      <p>Uncle Johnny’s Garlic Bread was founded five years ago by John Arlotta, a culinary innovator and the founder of <strong>Arlotta Food Studio</strong>—a brand known for its California-grown organic and kosher olive oils infused with essential oils, and its aged balsamic vinegars imported from Modena, Italy.</p>
      <p>John brought his deep passion for food to the festival scene, creating a unique concept that combined convenience, quality, and flavor: garlic bread grilled fresh on a stick, served hot and fast to thousands of eager festivalgoers.</p>
      <p>After years of successful events, John has passed the torch to <strong>Jake</strong>, a longtime mentee and close friend who has grown to be like family. Together for over a decade, their bond is the foundation of this next chapter.</p>
      <p>Now leading the charge, Jake is dedicated to preserving John’s legacy while scaling the brand—starting with more regional festivals and eventually food trucks and a franchise model. The garlic bread may be on a stick, but the vision is anything but small.</p>
